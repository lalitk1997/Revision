Exceptions

-> Exception Handling
    1. Powerful mechanism to handle run-time error, for normal flow of the application.
    2. Ex, SQLException, ClassNotFound, IOException, Arithmetic Exception etc.
    3. Helps in maintaining normal flow of program without abnormal termination.
    4.                              Throwable
                    ------------------------------------------

    5. Type of Exceptions :
    -> Checked Exception - Classes that directly inherit the Throwable class except RuntimeException.
                         - Checked exceptions are checked at compile time.
                         - IOException, SQLException.
    -> Unchecked Exception - Classes that inherit RuntimeException are known as Unchecked Exception.
                           - Unchecked exceptions are not checked at compile time.
                           - Arithmetic, NullPointer.
    -> Error - Errors are irrecoverable.
             - OutOfMemoryError, VirtualMachineError etc.
