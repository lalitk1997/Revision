1. HashMap
    - HashMap internally contains an array of Node and Node can represent a class having following :
        int hash
        K key
        V value
        Node next
    - Hashing is the process of converting an object into integer using the method hashCode().
    - Important to write hashCode() method properly for lesser collision and better performance of hashmap.

2. TreeMap
    - Implementation of Map Interfaces, NavigableMap, SortedMap and AbstractMap class.
    - Tree Map does not allow null keys (like Map) -> NullPointerException.

3. HashSet
    - HashMap provide an implementation of Set Interface via use of Hashing.

4. TreeSet
    - TreeSet provides an implementation of the Set Interface that uses a tree for storage.
    - Objects are stored in a sorted order. (Ascending Order)
    - TreeSet uses self-balancing binary search tree, more specifically Red-Black tree.
