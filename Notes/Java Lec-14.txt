Spring MVC :-

Web-Server vs Application Server


Browser -> (Request) -> Dispatcher Servlet (Front Controller Servlet) ->
Handler Mapping -> req/res -> Handler/Controller Class -> Service -> DAO
-> View Resolver -> Response to Browser/Client.

@Transactional Annotation

WEB-INF/views -> Location of JSP

Configuration file -> app.config
