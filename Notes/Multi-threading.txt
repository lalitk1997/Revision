Multi-threading

It's a process of executing two or more threads simultaneously for maximum utilization of the CPU.
A thread in java is a light-weight process requiring fewer resources to create and share the process resource.
Threads use a shared memory area which helps to save memory, content-switching between the threads is a bit faster.
