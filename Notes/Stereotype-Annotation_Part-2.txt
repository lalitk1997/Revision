Spring Framework provides us with some special annotations.
These annotations are used to create Spring beans automatically in the application context.
@Component annotation is the main Stereotype Annotation.
Some other stereotype annotation derived from @Component are :-
-> @Service
	It is used to indicate that the class on which this annotation is applied, have business logic written into it.
	Also, this annotation is used on all classes of service layer(business logic layer).
-> Repository
	Classes which are dealing with crud opearations are specified with Repository annotation.
-> Controller 
	Class with @Controller are reponsible for handling the user request and return the appropriate response.
	It is mostly used with REST Web Services.
