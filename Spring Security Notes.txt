Spring Security 

Lecture - 1
What is spring security really all about?
-> Provides application level security
	like
	-> Login and Logout functionality
	-> Allow/block access to URLs to logged in users.
	-> Allow/block access to URLs to logged in users AND with certain roles.
-> Handles common vulnerabilities 
	-> Session fixation
		-> Session Fixation is an attack that permits an attacker to hijack a valid user session.
	-> Clickjacking
		-> An attack that fools users into thinking they are clicking on one thing when they are actually clicking on another. 
	-> Cross site request forgery
-> Acts as a security guard for each incoming request and asks
	-> who are you?
	-> what do you want?
-> What spring security can do?
	-> Username/password authentication.
	-> SSO (Single Sign On) / Okta / LDAP
	-> App Level Authorization
	-> Intra App Authorization like OAuth
	-> Microservice security (using tokens, JWT)
	-> Method Level Security

Lecture - 2
-> Five Spring Security Concepts 
	-> Authentication
	-> Authorization
	-> Principal -> Currently Logged-In User
	-> Granted Authority -> User is authorised to access URLs
	-> Roles
-> Knowledge based authentication 
	-> Password, Pincode, Answer to a secret ques
-> Possession based authentication
	-> Phone / Text Message
	-> Key cards and badges
	-> Access token device
-> Multifactor Authentication
	-> Knowledge based authentication + Possession based authentication
-> Authentication -> Who is the user ?
-> Authorization -> Are they allowed to do this ?
-> Principal -> Currently logged in user.
-> Granted Authority
-> Roles -> Group of authorities assigned to each roles


Lecture-3
Adding Spring Security
-> spring-boot-starter-security dependency
-> by default have to login 
	-> User 
	-> Password provided in terminal 
-> filters (core concept associated with servlet technology) 
-> servlet are associated with resource url
	-> based upon the resource url servlets are fetched.
	-> filters acts as a moderator in between client requests and servlets.
-> Default behaviour of spring security :
	-> Adds mandatory authentication for URLs
	-> Adds login form
	-> Handles login error
	-> Creates a user ans sets a default password
-> application.properties (Configure default user -)
	-> spring.security.user.name=foo
	-> spring.security.user.password=foo

Lecture - 4
How to configure Spring Security Authentication
-> Hardcoding some user in memory for authentication
-> Authentication Manager : Does the authentication -> (Method) -> authenticate()
-> AuthenticationManagerBuilder Class (Use for authentication config)	
	-> Get hold of AuthenticationManagerBuilder
		-> Class Configure -> extend this class
		-> AuthManagerBuilder -> Override this method.
	-> Set the configuration on it
-> Github link :- https://github.com/koushikkothagal/spring-boot-security 
-> SecurityConfiguration -> Class Create extends WebSecurityConfigurerAdapter
-> @EnableWebSecurity for SecurityConfiguration
-> Always deal with hashed pawwords! 
@Override
protected void configure(AuthenticationManagerBuilder auth) throws Exception{
	auth.inMemoryAuthentication()
		.withUser("blah")
		.password("blah")
		.roles("user")
		.and()
		.withUser("foo")
		.password("foo")
		.roles("admin")
}
-> Passwords are not stored in plain text.
-> How to set a password encode ?
	-> Just expose an @Bean of type PasswordEncoder!
	@Bean
	public PasswordEncode getPasswordEncode(){
		return NoOpPasswordEncoder.getInsatnce();
	}

Lecture-5
How to configure authorization in Spring Security
Starting point
A Spring Boot application with
- Spring Security dependency added
- In-Memory authentication configured

=> /      -> All (unauthenticated)
=> /user  -> USER and ADMIN role
=> /admin -> ADMIN role
-> Object Type HttpSecurity to configure
-> extend WebSecurityConfigureAdapter
protected void configure(HttpSecurity http) throws Exception {
	// Use-of-method-chaining
	
}

Double Shift -> To search for all classes

1. Spring security is looking for bean/Object of type SecurityFilterChain (Interface)
2. SecurityFilterChainConfiguration -> Available here
3. Functionality of Basic Auth
	Client 		Backend
		------------>  HTTP Request(GET)
						|  Checks Authorisation
		<------------  Returns 401 UNAUTHORIZED
		
		------------>  HTTP Request (GET) => Basic64 username:password
						|  Checks username:password
		<------------  Responds: 200 OK
4. Spring Security picks SecurityFilterChain Bean provided by us rather than default.
5. Manually Configuring the SecurityConfiguration Class
6. Testing spring security using POSTMAN -> Basic authentication
7. Spring Boot Version 2.7.4
